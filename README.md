Abstract
This study explores advancements in algorithmic trading through the integration of OpenAI's artificial intelligence, focusing on enhancing signal generation. Utilizing OpenAI's GPT-4-turbo-preview, the research develops a decision-making model, expressed as Decision (Is) = f(Ns, Fs, Ps, M). This model includes news sentiment analysis (Ns), financial statements signals (Fs), price dynamics analysis (Ps), and macroeconomic indicators (M) to create a comprehensive approach to market analysis. These components work together to interpret a variety of financial data inputs, facilitating informed and timely trading decisions.
The application of this AI-driven model in trading strategy for Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock over a month demonstrated improved trading efficiency and decision accuracy, achieving a 75% success rate in predicting market movements. The model's ability to process and analyze large, complex datasets in real-time allowed it to adapt dynamically to market conditions and generate accurate trading signals. The integration of diverse data types through AI enabled anticipation of market trends and supported ethical deployment of AI technologies in trading, emphasizing transparency and fairness.
This exploration highlights the potential of AI in financial trading, promising advancements in the precision and speed of algorithmic trading practices. As AI evolves, its deeper integration into financial sectors is expected to revolutionize real-time data processing and decision-making, setting new industry benchmarks. This study not only underscores the effectiveness of AI-enhanced trading systems but also outlines a future where algorithmic trading can achieve high levels of market analysis and investment precision.
